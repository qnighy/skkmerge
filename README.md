# Compilation

Before compilation you'll need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

```
$ cargo build
$ cargo install
```

# Usage

For example, to know difference between userdict and skkdict in CorvusSKK,

```
$ skkmerge ~/AppData/Roaming/CorvusSKK/userdict.txt -s ~/AppData/Roaming/CorvusSKK/skkdict.txt
```
